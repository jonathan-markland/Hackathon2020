Alignment Disc Measurement Pairing software - User Instructions
===============================================================

	** Please do not use this software until you have read the STAGING section **

Deliverables
============
(Because of time constraints some of this is less nice than it could be)
The software consists of a ZIP file to be unzipped onto the computer that will perform 
the file processing.  


Installation
============
You will need to make a folder for the program installation.
Then you will need to make two folders for the program's operation with the CMM
files.

For the program installation:-
I suggest making a folder inside the "Documents" folder belonging to the user that 
will use the software, because this will ensure appropriate access rights to the 
program's files and also to the Config.txt file.  For example something like:

	C:\Users\Dale\Documents\CMMProcessor

Unzip the ZIP file in order to establish the program files within the above folder.

For the CMM operation:-
You will need to create two folders for the CMM machine's file sets, the first of
which is like an input hopper where you will save the CMM files.  The second will 
contain the processing output history each time this software is used.
(This will be described further in 'Configuring the software').


Creating a Desktop Shortcut
===========================
One you have installed:-
Locate the 'ProcessCMM.bat' program file.  We need this to make the shortcut.
Use the RIGHT HAND mouse button to drag the program file to the desktop.  When the
menu appears select 'Create shortcuts here'.  

The icon should appear but DO NOT CLICK IT YET.  The program needs configuring first.


Configuring the software
========================
Locate the 'Config.txt' file, in the installation folder.  This contains the 
configuration settings that you will need to tune the software.

You cannot move the Config.txt file, but you could keep copies elsewhere, which I
strongly suggest, in case you have problems and need to revert settings.

You should open the Config.txt file in a Notepad program.  I suggest using the 
Notepad++ software, and this has a good undo facility, search, and replace.


The organisation of the Config.txt file
=======================================
The config file has "keys" and "values".  The "keys" are to the left of the equals
signs, and the values are to the right, for example:

			SourceFolder = C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\Dale\CMMSourceFiles
			HistoryFolder = C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\Dale\PairingHistory

			NumberOfPairs = 15

			FlatParaToleranceGradeA =0.002
					... etc


		!! You need to be careful not to change the "keys", !!
		!! particularly with search and replace.  Do not    !!
		!! remove any keys, either.                         !!


You can use a # sign at the left side, to make a comment in the Config.txt file, 
if you need to.


Configuration Options
=====================

				!! All settings described below must be present in the 
				   Config.txt, please do not remove any of them. !!

To best understand this section, please review the real Config.txt file side-by-side
with this documentation.  The supplied Config.txt file is set up to the same labels
and settings as was used in the CMM files at the Hackathon.

Some of these settings adjust HEADINGS and LABELS that the software will used to
locate data within the file.  The file order is flexible except that the headings
must exist, and must come before the related labels.


	SourceFolder  | Contains the location of the source CMM files, the input "hopper".
	              | When saving out from the CMM software, this is the folder to save to.
	
	HistoryFolder | Contains the location of the output file sets.  The software automatically
	              | uses a history format, where new sub-folders are made including the date 
	              | and time of processing.

	NumberOfPairs | The number of disc pairs you want, each time you run this software.

	                        | Flatness and parallelism tolerances in microns:
	FlatParaToleranceGradeA | The worst deviation (microns) permitted for Grade A    eg: 0.002
	FlatParaToleranceGradeB | The worst deviation (microns) permitted for Grade B    eg: 0.0025
	                        | Note that anything worse that these will be a Grade C

	DistTarget              | The target diagonal distance (microns) eg: 28.020
	DistToleranceGradeA     | The worst deviation (microns), either side, for Grade A eg: 0.001
	DistToleranceGradeB     | The worst deviation (microns), either side, for Grade B eg: 0.002

	Serial number label     | The exact text to the left of the serial number in the CMM file.
	                        | This must include the colon, and any and all internal spaces.
	                        | Copy these *precisely* from the CMM file.
	                        | For example:   
	                        |                             vvvvvv--------- important spaces!
	                        |                    Serial No      :

	Flatness F heading      | The heading above the Datum F flatness field.  (Needed for locating data).
	Flatness E heading      | The heading above the Datum E flatness field.  (Needed for locating data).
	Flatness D heading      | The heading above the Datum D flatness field.  (Needed for locating data).
	Flatness G heading      | The heading above the Datum G flatness field.  (Needed for locating data).
	Flatness value label    | The label to the left of the flatness fields.
	                        | !! While this label can be altered, the flatness label must have only
	                        |    one numeric value to the right of it, which is the flatness reading. 
	                        |    This is because of time constraints on this project, and because the
	                        |    original CMM machine report used this layout. !!

	Parallelism section heading | The section heading above the parallelism section.  This is
	                            | used to latch in for accuracy, and must exist.
								
	Parallelism label 1         | The label that introduces the  Datum E LH 1  value.
	Parallelism label 2         | The label that introduces the  Datum E RH 1  value.
	Parallelism label 3         | The label that introduces the  Datum G FR 1  value.
	Parallelism label 4         | The label that introduces the  Datum G BK 1  value.
	                            | !! While these labels can be altered, each label must have TWO
	                            |    numeric values to its right, the second of which is the reading.
	                            |    This is because of time constraints on this project, and because
	                            |    the original CMM machine report used this layout. !!

	Distance heading 1          | The section heading above the E-F distance section.  This is
	                            | used to latch in for accuracy, and must exist.

	Distance label 1            | The label that introduces the  E to F at -1.5 LH   value.
	Distance label 2            | The label that introduces the  E to F at -1.5 RH   value.
	Distance label 3            | The label that introduces the  E to F at -10.3 LH  value.
	Distance label 4            | The label that introduces the  E to F at -10.3 RH  value.
	                            | !! While these labels can be altered, each label must have FOUR
	                            |    numeric values to its right, the third of which is the reading.

Using the software
==================
As part of installation, we made a desktop icon.
Double-clicking the icon will activate the software, which performs these processes:

	- Checks access is possible to the SourceFolder
	- Checks access is possible to the HistoryFolder
	- Checks the number of files in the SourceFolder is less than 1000
	  which is a measure to protect against long software run times.
	- Examines every file in the SourceFolder, stopping if any overall failure.
	- Chooses a new name for the output folder for this session, based on
	  the current date and time instant at which the program was run.
	- Attempts to create the output folder, raising an error if it already 
	  exists (although this should never happen because of the date/time usage!)
	- For your traceability, copies the Config.txt file to the output folder.
	- Calculate the disc pairings using those files that could successfully
	  be read.  We only take the best-matched pairs (quantity as configured).
	- We generate, and save, the disc loading report, to the output folder.
	- We generate, and save, the disc pairing report, to the output folder.
	- All CMM files that successfully paired off are moved to the output
	  folder to keep them out of the way of future pairing exercises.
	- A success message is written to the black console window.
	
If the program fails, then an error may be written to the black console window,
or you will find details of the situation described within the Loading Report
or Pairing Report files that were saved to the output history folder.


Undo!
=====
If you wished you hadn't pressed the button(!) then simply navigate to the
HistoryFolder, and find the latest output folder (sorting by name is recommended 
for this).

Then, simply move any CMM files therein back to the SourceFolder.

If you do this, you could consider erasing the output folder in question
since its report files will no longer contain up-to-date information, and 
could cause confusion for end-users in future, although there is no 
requirement from the software to do this.



What happens when you get more than one CMM machine
===================================================
You can install separate copies of this software on whichever computers you
require.

However, whatever you do in this situation, I strongly recommend that separate
software installations use DIFFERENT Source and History folders, because
otherwise operation will conflict.

If you have two sites measuring discs, and you also wanted to pair discs across
sites, I suggest that you collect the CMM files at a central site, and only
one copy of this program should process the pairing.  This is only a software
recommendation, I cannot comment on the appropriateness of pairing discs that
have been measured on different CMM machines!  If you are an operator reading 
this manual, please seek management approval first.



Maintenance of the folders
==========================
Over time the history folder will collect multiple pairing report sub-folders.
There is no requirement to keep these, except for your records. 
They can be archived to another location if desired, without impacting the
operation of the software for future pairing operations.



STAGING
=======
The term "Staging" is when new software is tested for the first time.  This should
always be performed using computers, files, and folders, that are completely separate 
from the real "Live" system.

You can achieve this by initially installing the program on an office laptop, and
taking some copies of CMM files over.  You will need to alter the Config.txt file
as described above, but use folders on the local laptop, not the real folders on
the network!

Once you are satisfied that the software works, and you understand how to deal with
any operational issues, only then should you install and configure the software on 
the Live system.
