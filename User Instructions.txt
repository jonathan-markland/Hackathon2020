Alignment Disc Measurement Pairing software - User Instructions
===============================================================

	** Please do not use this software until you have read the STAGING section **

Deliverables
============
(Because of time constraints some of this is less nice than it could be)
The software consists of a ZIP file to be unzipped onto the computer that will perform 
the file processing.  

Installation
============
You will need to make a folder for the program installation.
Then you will need to make two folders for the program's operation with the CMM
files.

For the program installation:-
I suggest making a folder inside the "Documents" folder belonging to the user that 
will use the software, because this will ensure appropriate access rights to the 
program's files and also to the Config.txt file.  For example something like:

	C:\Users\Dale\Documents\CMMProcessor

Unzip the ZIP file in order to establish the program files within the above folder.

For the CMM operation:-
You will need to create two folders for the CMM machine's file sets, the first of
which is like an input hopper, and the second contains the processing output history.
This will be described further in 'Configuring the software'.

Creating a Desktop Shortcut
===========================
One you have installed:-
Locate the 'DaleHackathon2020.exe' program file.  We need this to make the shortcut.
Use the RIGHT HAND mouse button to drag the program file to the desktop.  When the
menu appears select 'Create shortcuts here'.  

The icon should appear but DO NOT CLICK IT YET.  The program needs configuring first.

Configuring the software
========================
Locate the 'Config.txt' file, in the installation.  This contains the configuration
settings that you will need to tune the software.

You cannot move the Config.txt file, but you could keep copies elsewhere, which I
strongly suggest, in case you have problems and need to revert settings.

You should open the Config.txt file in a Notepad program.  I suggest using the 
Notepad++ software, and this has a good undo facility, search, and replace.

The organisation of the Config.txt file
=======================================
The config file has "keys" and "values".  The "keys" are to the left of the equals
signs, and the values are to the right, for example:

			SourceFolder = C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\Dale\CMMSourceFiles
			HistoryFolder = C:\Users\Jonathan\Documents\Dale\PairingHistory

			NumberOfPairs = 15

			FlatParaToleranceGradeA =0.002
					... etc


		!! You need to be careful not to change the "keys", !!
		!! particularly with search and replace.  Do not    !!
		!! remove any keys, either.                         !!


You can use a # sign at the left side, to make a comment in the Config.txt file, 
if you need to.

Configuration Options
=====================

	SourceFolder  | Contains the location of the source CMM files, the input "hopper".
	
	HistoryFolder | Contains the location of the output files, which will automatically
	              | be turned into a history format, since sub-folders are made by the
	              | software that include the date and time of processing.

	NumberOfPairs | The number of pairs you want at a time.

	FlatParaToleranceGradeA | Flatness and parallelism tolerances in microns.
	FlatParaToleranceGradeB | The worst tolerance (microns) permitted for Grade A    eg: 0.002
	                        | The worst tolerance (microns) permitted for Grade B    eg: 0.0025
	                        | Note that anything worse that these will be a Grade C

	DistTarget=28.020
	DistToleranceGradeA= 0.001
	DistToleranceGradeB =0.002

	Program name label   = Program Name   :
	Date time label      = Date / Time    :
	Drawing number label = Drawing No     :
	Serial number label  = Serial No      :
	Issue number label   = Issue No       :
	Description label    = Description    :

	Flatness F heading = Datum F
	Flatness E heading = Datum E
	Flatness D heading = Datum D
	Flatness G heading = Datum G
	Flatness value label = Flatness

	Parallelism section heading = Parallelism - 4 opposed positions
	Parallelism label 1 = Datum E LH 1
	Parallelism label 2 = Datum E RH 1
	Parallelism label 3 = Datum G FR 1
	Parallelism label 4 = Datum G BK 1

	Distance heading 1=Datum E to Datum F - (diagonals at -1.5 & -10.3)
	Distance label 1 = E to F at -1.5 LH
	Distance label 2 = E to F at -1.5 RH
	Distance label 3 = E to F at -10.3 LH
	Distance label 4 = E to F at -10.3 RH

	Distance heading 2 = Datum G to Datum D - (diagonals at -1.5 & -10.3)
	Distance label 5 = G to D at -1.5 FR
	Distance label 6 = G to D at -1.5 BK
	Distance label 7 = G to D at -10.3 FR
	Distance label 8 = G to D at -10.3 BK




STAGING
=======
The term "Staging" is when new software is tested for the first time.  This should
always be performed using computers, files, and folders, that are completely separate 
from the real "Live" system.

You can achieve this by initially installing the program on an office laptop, and
taking some copies of CMM files over.  You will need to alter the Config.txt file
as described above, but use staged folders, not the real ones!

Once you are satisfied that the software works, and you understand how to deal with
any operational issues, only then should you install and configure the software on 
the Live system.
